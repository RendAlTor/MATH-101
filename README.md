# MATH-101

This repository is for R Markdown files used to generate the "lectures" for Nefas's and Atsona's ESO Academy "class" MATH 101, where I go over the mathematics behind ESO.

In order to use these R Markdown files, you will need to download R and RStudio. These programs are free to download. Alternatively, you can directly download the knitted HTML files from the R Markdown files.

You can read more about R here: https://www.r-project.org/
